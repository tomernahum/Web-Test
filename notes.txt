Todo / to learn:
- Learn SEO/accessability tags and stuff instead of div and span


- Learn Grid and any other CSS+responsive design missing pieces

- specifically for landing page project the image should actually wrap (theres a flex wrap but all that happens is the image shrinks)

- highlight (bold) some entries in the index for people to go there first (eg universe splitter)

- Add favicon (should be able to add .ico file in root)
