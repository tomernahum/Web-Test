
Following along with https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

I will demonstrate knowledge of basic HTML without CSS

I am doing this as part of my larger project instead of as its own repository because that is what I feel like doing
I am going to be treating it like it could be its own folder / website, meaning i'll call the home page index.html and whatever else

This will be a recipe website
