(Might be holes in knowledge)

- Files in public folder are copy and pasted directly by webpack when building (minified though I think)
- Files in src are compiled
- 

- Files in public are considered static and in src (dynamic?),;
  though its both js which could be deployed to a static hosting provider


- You can import CSS files into js thanks to webpack (not vanilla js feature)



TODO:
- figure out github actions for building
- Do fullstackopen hw/quizes

TO Learn / review (non react):
- list all differences btwn arrow functions and regular functions,
with an emphasis on how exporting them works (are they different while exporting, why do you need default for normal function)
- Use of && and || logical opperators 
- Spread operator  (for copying objects,  arrays, any other usage)


- Dev opinions on iifes in react
