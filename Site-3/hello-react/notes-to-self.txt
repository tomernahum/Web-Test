(Might be holes in knowledge)

- Files in public folder are copy and pasted directly by webpack when building (minified though I think)
- Files in src are compiled
- 

- Files in public are considered static and in src (dynamic?),;
  though its both js which could be deployed to a static hosting provider


- You can import CSS files into js thanks to webpack (not vanilla js feature)
